# eating-out-log

I made this as a fun side project, it's just a way to keep record of all the places someone has eaten at as long as they keep updating it

There's also a cool way to randomize a selection of what to eat out (with the selection pool being what's added to its database)
You can also pick and choose which categories of food to include in the selection pool
